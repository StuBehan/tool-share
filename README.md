### Tool Share

- An idea to make an app where users can create item pages for tools they may have so that they can share them with their own community, to reduce e-waste and the expense of purchasing tools or equipment that they might not be needed often. 
- Example: A lawn mower, irregularly used by someone with a small lawn, could be shared between neighbours to reduce the number of lawnmowers required to service multiple small yards.
